## My Personal Experience

I am glad to share that I've Secured Global Rank of #3393 & Indian Rank of #2647 in Google Kick Start Round-G on Octuber 15th 2022. This is My First Experience & Belive Me it was Worth It, hoping to do Even Better in Further Rounds :)

## What is Google Kick Start

Google Kickstart, formerly known as APAC is a test designed to hire people who are looking for a career in Google. The major difference between its former form and Kickstart is that there will be more testing rounds than before and is targeted to any age group rather than graduating students.

Designed to hire the best minds of the Asia Pacific region, the test primarily focuses on problem-solving abilities, Data Structures, and algorithms. Preparing for Kickstart involves getting familiar with its judging environment because it is quite different from other problems.

There will be eight online rounds of algorithms quizzes designed by Google Engineers, Each round of eight online rounds consists of four coding problems.

And The Top Participants from each Round may be Invited to Interview for a Role at Google
